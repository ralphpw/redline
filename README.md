# Redline

> **"AI superpowers for non-technical professionals"**

Redline gives knowledge workers the same AI + version control capabilities that developers have — without the technical complexity.

---

## Three Superpowers

### 1. 📝 Redline Review
> *"Redlining a doc"*

Human + AI as co-authors with **bi-directional review**:
- AI edits your document — you see exactly what changed
- You edit your document — AI reviews for issues
- Every version saved, every change reversible

**Trust without blind acceptance.**

### 2. ⚡ Redline Performance  
> *"Pushing it to the redline"*

Develop workflows with AI, then automate at scale:
- Build a process collaboratively on 3 samples
- Save it as a reusable template
- Run against 47 inputs overnight
- Review the AI's review — not 47 documents

**10x productivity on repetitive knowledge work.**

### 3. 📁 Case History
> *"Building institutional knowledge"*

Every case, every argument, every outcome — tracked:
- Full context per case (documents, correspondence, history)
- Track which approaches win
- Templates from successful patterns
- New hires inherit years of expertise

**Your organization gets smarter over time.**

## Who Is This For?

| You Are | You Need | Redline Gives You |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **Lawyer** | Review AI contract edits safely | Redline Review |
| **Claims processor** | Scale dispute arguments | Case History + Automation |
| **Business analyst** | AI-assisted specs with accountability | Redline Review |
| **Compliance officer** | Auditable AI-assisted documentation | Full audit trail |
| **Anyone with important emails** | See what AI actually changed | Redline Review |

## The Core Problem We Solve

**Today's AI tools are broken for serious work:**
- ChatGPT: No diff. No history. "What did AI change?" 🤷
- Copilot in Word: Single document. No cross-doc context.
- Google Docs AI: Sidebar only. Can't see exactly what it did.

**Developers solved this years ago:** Git + diff + AI agents.

**Redline packages this for everyone else** — no command line, no branches, no merge conflicts. Just: **edit → review → approve**.
